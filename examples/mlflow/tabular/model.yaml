  summary: "The Factorization Machines algorithm is a general-purpose supervised learning algorithm that you can use for both
            classification and regression tasks. "
  details: "It is an extension of a linear model that is designed to capture interactions between features within high dimensional
            sparse datasets economically. For example, in a click prediction system, the Factorization Machines model can capture click
            rate patterns observed when ads from a certain ad-category are placed on pages from a certain page-category. Factorization
            machines are a good choice for tasks dealing with high dimensional sparse datasets, such as click prediction and item recommendation."

    #OVERVIEW:
    The prediction task for a Factorization Machines model is to estimate a function Å· from a feature set xi to a target domain.
    This domain is real-valued for regression and binary for classification. The Factorization Machines model is supervised and so
    has a training dataset (xi,yj) available.

    #TRAINING:
    For training, the Factorization Machines algorithm currently supports only the recordIO-protobuf format with Float32 tensors.
    Because their use case is predominantly on sparse data, CSV is not a good candidate. Both File and Pipe mode training are supported
    for recordIO-wrapped protobuf.

    #VALIDATION:

    For inference, the Factorization Machines algorithm supports the application/json and x-recordio-protobuf formats.

      - For the binary classification problem, the algorithm predicts a score and a label. The label is a number and can be either 0 or 1.
      The score is a number that indicates how strongly the algorithm believes that the label should be 1. The algorithm computes score first
      and then derives the label from the score value. If the score is greater than or equal to 0.5, the label is 1.
      - For the regression problem, just a score is returned and it is the predicted value. For example, if Factorization Machines is used to
      predict a movie rating, score is the predicted rating value.


    #INPUT SPECIFICATION:

  performance: "The Factorization Machines algorithm reports three binary classification metrics, which are computed during training. When tuning the model for binary classification tasks,
                choose one of these as the objective."

releaseNotes: "The Amazon SageMaker implementation of the Factorization Machines algorithm considers only pair-wise (2nd order) interactions between features."
