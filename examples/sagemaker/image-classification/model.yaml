  summary: "The Amazon SageMaker image classification algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm that supports multi-label classification."
  details: "It takes an image as input and outputs one or more labels assigned to that image. It uses a convolutional neural network (ResNet)
            that can be trained from scratch or trained using transfer learning when a large number of training images are not available."
  technical: |-
    #OVERVIEW:
    The recommended input format for the Amazon SageMaker image classification algorithms is Apache MXNet RecordIO.

    #TRAINING:
    If you use the RecordIO format for training, specify both train and validation channels as values for the InputDataConfig parameter of the
    CreateTrainingJob request. Specify one RecordIO (.rec) file in the train channel and one RecordIO file in the validation channel. Set the
    content type for both channels to application/x-recordio.

    #VALIDATION:
    The image classification model processes a single image per request and so outputs only one line in the JSON or JSON Lines format. The
    following is an example of a response in JSON Lines format:

    accept: application/jsonlines

    {"prediction": [prob_0, prob_1, prob_2, prob_3, ...]}


    #INPUT SPECIFICATION:
    The generated models can be hosted for inference and support encoded .jpg and .png image formats as image/png, image/jpeg, and
    application/x-image content-type. The input image is resized automatically.

    #OUTPUT DETAILS:
    The output is the probability values for all classes encoded in JSON format, or in JSON Lines text format for batch transform.

    For image classification, we support the following GPU instances for training: ml.p2.xlarge, ml.p2.8xlarge, ml.p2.16xlarge, ml.p3.2xlarge,
    ml.p3.8xlargeand ml.p3.16xlarge. We recommend using GPU instances with more memory for training with large batch sizes. However, both CPU (such
    as C4) and GPU (such as P2 and P3) instances can be used for the inference. You can also run the algorithm on multi-GPU and multi-machine settings
    for distributed training.

  performance: "Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score"
releaseNotes: "Image classification in Amazon SageMaker can be run in two modes: full training and transfer learning."
